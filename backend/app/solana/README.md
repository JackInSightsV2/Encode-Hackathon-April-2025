# Solana Escrow API (Solana Blockchain Contract)

This is a simple escrow API service for Solana that allows users to deposit, check balance, and spend funds. The service uses SQLite for storage and FastAPI for the API framework.

We wanted to use the Solana blockchain to facilitate transactions but we ran out of time. This Escrow API is time-efficient alternative.
