Now that our **frontend UI** and **Solana smart contract** are both working, here's a clear, structured task list to complete the rest of our MVP.

---

## ✅ **MVP Completion Task List**

---

### ⚙️ **1. Connect Frontend to Deployed Solana Contract**

**Goal:** Call `register_agent` and `invoke_agent` from the frontend using Phantom wallet and the manually constructed IDL.

#### Tasks:
- [X] Add Phantom wallet connection via `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`.
- [ ] Load and embed the **explicit IDL** in your frontend code (same as test file). This is in solana-contract
- [ ] Instantiate an Anchor `Program` client in the browser using:
  - your **program ID**
  - the **IDL**
  - the connected wallet
- [ ] Build and test:
  - [ ] `registerAgent(name, description, endpoint, price)` call
  - [ ] `invokeAgent(agentPubkey, ownerPubkey)` call

---

### 🔄 **2. Backend API for Agent Invocation and Logging**

**Goal:** Create a basic FastAPI/Express backend to:
- Receive Solana transaction signature
- Verify transaction on-chain
- Log the AI agent usage
- Optionally, route to an AI endpoint

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Set up FastAPI or Express backend with `/invoke-agent` POST route
- [ ] Accept:
  ```json
  {
    "agentPubkey": "...",
    "txSignature": "...",
    "userInput": "..."
  }
  ```
- [ ] Use `solana-py`
  - [ ] Confirm transaction on-chain
  - [ ] Validate lamport transfer and destination
- [ ] If valid:
  - [ ] Log it (file, Redis, or in-memory)
  - [ ] Return a mock or real AI result (e.g. hardcoded string or OpenAI API call)

---

### 🎨 **3. Dynamic Agent Listing & Usage**

**Goal:** Replace dummy agents with real agents from the blockchain

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Use `connection.getProgramAccounts()` to fetch all Agent accounts
- [ ] Deserialize accounts with Anchor layout
- [ ] Display:
  - Name, Description, Price, Endpoint
  - “Use Agent” button

---

### 🛠️ **4. Final Features & Edge Handling**

**Goal:** Finish the glue between user interaction and agent usage.

#### Tasks:
- [ ] On successful `invokeAgent()`:
  - [ ] Show loading
  - [ ] Send `txSignature` to backend
  - [ ] Display returned result
- [ ] Handle:
  - [ ] Invalid transactions
  - [ ] Program rejections
  - [ ] Insufficient funds
- [ ] Optional: Add user feedback or ratings to agents

---

### 🧪 **5. QA / Test / Bugfix**

**Goal:** Ensure smooth demo and validation.

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Try registering multiple agents
- [ ] Use an alt wallet to invoke someone else’s agent
- [ ] Try failing flows (no lamports, wrong owner)
- [ ] Try frontend ↔ backend ↔ on-chain flow end to end

---

### 🚀 **6. (Optional but Nice): Final Polish for Hackathon**

**Goal:** Make your MVP clean, demo-ready, and memorable.

#### Bonus Tasks:
- [ ] Display Agent invocation history (from backend)
- [ ] Show how much SOL each agent has earned
- [ ] Add “Test Agent” button that runs the whole flow with dummy input
- [ ] Style the site to feel like a marketplace or mission control UI
