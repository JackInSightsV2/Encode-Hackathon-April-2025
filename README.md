# Test it live!
http://18.130.169.158:3000/

## Hackathon MVP Submission

SolAI is a decentralized marketplace that connects AI agent developers with users on the Solana blockchain. Our platform enables seamless discovery, monetization, and integration of AI agents while leveraging Solana's fast and low-cost transactions.

## üöÄ Vision

In a world where AI capabilities are rapidly expanding, SolAI aims to:

- **Democratize AI Access**: Make powerful AI agents accessible to everyone through a user-friendly marketplace
- **Empower Developers**: Provide AI creators with tools to monetize their agents and reach a wider audience
- **Build on Solana**: Utilize Solana's speed and efficiency for microtransactions and tokenized agent ownership

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Wallet-Based Authentication**: Secure login using Solana wallets
- **Agent Discovery**: Browse and search for AI agents by category, popularity, or use case
- **API Key Management**: Generate and manage API keys for seamless integration
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor your agent usage and earnings in real-time
- **Solana Payments**: Pay for AI agent usage with SOL or SPL tokens

## üñ•Ô∏è Demo Setup

The easiest way to explore our MVP is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up
```

Once running:
- Access the marketplace at: http://localhost:3000
- Connect your Solana wallet to explore the full functionality
- We recommend using Phantom Wallet and switch it to the devnet; you may need to give yourselves some SOL using the Solana CLI

## üí° Use Cases

- **Developers**: Monetize your AI agents and reach a wider audience
- **Businesses**: Find specialized AI solutions for your unique needs
- **Users**: Discover and integrate AI capabilities into your projects

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

- **Phase 1** (Current MVP): Core marketplace and wallet integration
- **Phase 2**: On-chain agent ownership with NFTs and custom tokens
- **Phase 3**: Agent composition allowing the creation of multi-agent workflows
- **Phase 4**: Developer SDK and expanded ecosystem integrations
